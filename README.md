## Precommit Setup
We use Google docstring format for our docstrings and the pre-commit library to check our code. To install pre-commit, run the following command:

```bash
conda install pre-commit  # or pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you try to commit changes to the repository.
